This encryption system was made in C language for a 1st year college project

It shows an example of the simplest encryption algorithm possible and is good for anyone just starting to learn about encryption.

Algorithm:
 1) Input message
 2) Convert to corresponding ASCII value
 3) Convert to any base between 2 and 10 (randomly generated). This is the encryption key.
 4) Convert to corresponding special characters
 5) The message is finally encrypted. For decrypting, simply ask the user for the key and reverse the procedure.
